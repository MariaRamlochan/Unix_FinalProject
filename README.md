MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT!
We would say that our major achievements would be that,

-We were able to complete the labs relatively quickly and effiecently without to much hicups.

-The way that we communicated during the project, was nothing less then efficent and practical. We work by being on 
call and by doing the work together at the same time so that we understand what the other teammate understands and 
does not undersatnds. Being in a call really helps the pace of the work go smoothly.

-Seting up the git repository was, to us, easily made and we were glad that anything, github related, was working as 
it was intended to.

-The website that we were able to launch, because, we poured a lot of efforts into making the visual of the website 
as beautiful as we could possibly make, and we think that the efforts really paid off.

OVERALL LESSONS!
We would say that our overall lesson is that, generating a website does require a lot of work but at the same time it 
doesn't take that much time to deploy one. We did took a little bit more time than anticipated but we would blame that 
on our inexperience on the subject. Now that we know how to deploy it, we feel that next time it shouldn't take that long.
