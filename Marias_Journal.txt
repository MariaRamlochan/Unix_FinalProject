Maria’s Journal

Journal log:
- April 16, 2021
•	Started working on the lab with my teammate Nafees, but unfortunately got stuck since my ssh was denied. I sent a mio to the teacher asking for a bit of assistance.

- April 17, 2021
-Personal notes: To recover is to reinstall the system -> OVH control panel ->
OS/Distribution -> reinstall my VPS -> new email with credentials will be sent.
•	Completed the lab and discussed the type of team website that we wanted to create with my teammate.
- April 23rd, 2021
•	Created a git repository called Unix_FinalProject.
•	Inside the Settings of that repository, Under Manage access, I invited my teammate Nafees.
•	Had trouble figuring out where to clone the repository. Local machine? Server?
•	Decided to clone my repository in my local machine in my Home directory.
-Testing out git commands. Note to self:
- git add * (for multiple files) / git add (filename)
- git commit -m “(comments/updates)”
- git push
- git pull (retrieve changes) 
•	Trying the merge
•	I pushed a file to the repository and my teammate Nafees also tried to push without pulling first.
•	We learned how to resolve the conflict by removing the lines with >>>/===/<<< after pulling and repushing.
•	We created two separate files that we will both push without pulling.
•	To resolve this issue, we just did git pull and then git push to send the updated version with my changes. The process for two different files is the almost the same as not pulling while editing the same file.

•	Started part 2 of the lab.
•	We installed all necessary dependencies for the Ruby by following the instructions provided.
•	Then we had to echo a few lines to the .bashrc, my teammate had trouble because he did not copy the path correctly (view #2 part 2). 
•	Proceeding, we did the Jekyll new (name of the blog/site) to create a Jekyll website. This also provides us with _site folder that was generated. The website can be viewed by this link http://localhost/: 4000.
•	We then added some lines in the index.markdown file to be able to edit the site. After, on the website, it displayed those line.
•	We had a lot of issues making the theme work. Even after the teacher updated the instructions, we were unable to properly display the theme. I will ask the teacher for a better example on how to execute this step (#7 part 2) later.

•	Started part 3 of the lab.
•	Inside our team repository (Unix_FinalProject) I cleared all the files from lab 12 to have an empty repository instead of recreating another one. My teammate pulled the changes.
•	I entered the local repository and created a new site (Jekyll new teamSite). Added and committed the changes, then pushed it to the repository. My teammate pulled the changes.
•	Next, I realized that I was not supposed to send the entire teamSite to the repository since certain files were needed to be ignored in the .gitignore.
•	Me and my teammate, then both created the teamSite on both our ends.
•	We discover that the .gitignore file was unseen in the directory of the teamSite folder, but after doing vim .gitignore, we saw that the file was already populated with a few instructions to be ignored. We just added the files that were autogenerated to the .gitignore.

-April 29th, 2021
•	Resuming part 3
•	My teammate went into his user on the server and installed (sudo apt-get installed ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev). 
•	I also did the same step but got a message that another process is using it
(view #6 part #3). 
•	After, it was installed for my teammate, I did not need to redo the installation.  
•	Basically, redid the steps from #2 part 2 but in the vps.
•	Also had to install git in the vps to be able to use the git commands.
•	After cloning the repository, we pulled the files from the remote repository. 
•	Also, I somehow accidentally deleted my Gemfile.lock. → 
steps I took to retrieve it:
-Entered my local teamSite folder on the virtual machine
-Copy the Genfile.lock to the vps by doing: scp Gemfile.lock maria@ip:.... 
-Then I re-entered the vps and moved it to the 
•	cloned repository. 
•	For more clarification on #9 part 2: My teammate was the one who moved the _site file to the team folder by doing: cp -r _site /var/www/html/team. I just checked if it was successfully done by doing ls in team folder.
